Useful tools/links for optimizing the Fedora boot process:

This will display the slow services when booting OS.

sudo systemd-analyze blame

To display the boot process using a SVG chart:

sudo systemd-analyze plot > /tmp/boot.svg && xdg-open /tmp/boot.svg

Based on this list you can disable non important devices with:

sudo systemctl disable vmware.service

The option "mask" can be used instead of "disable", but that will disable the service even for manual start.

List of services that are not needed as boot:

vmware.service (services needed to run VMware virtual machines)
jexec.service (direct execution of JAR files on Linux)
avahi-daemon (detection of network devices such as printers and scanners)

(live CD services)
for i in livesys livesys-late spice-vdagentd ; do sudo systemctl disable $i;done
